# handtracking-photo-editor
A photo editing app that uses Handtrack.js to edit pictures using hand motions.



<h2>How to use</h2>
<p>Open index.html in your browser and grant it permission to use your web cam. Once the model is loaded, it will begin hand tracking. Upload an image
and start moving your hands around to see the result effects in the image. Works best when the canvas containing the image has the same dimensions as the
canvas containing the video. I recommend using images that are 640px by 480px</p>
